AngularJS

- primar1ly used to make single page, data-driven applications
- additional content brought into the web page without the need to refresh
- use 'views' (the V in MVC) to achieve this

What is MVC?

- programming methodology aiming to split to three core components

Model
	- think of the model as data
	- json, database data etc.

View
	- used to display content & data to a user in a browser
	- html
	- use expressions to insert data into views 
		<html tag> {{ data }} </html tag>

Controller
	- Control the functionality of our views
	- performs the interaction between our models and our views
	- the javascript, jquery etc.

Example: Showing a list of users when a button is clicked

	The 'View' displays the button
	The 'Controller' detects if the button has been clicked
	The 'Controller' talks to the 'Model' to get the list of the users
	The 'Controller' then brings the list of the users to the 'View'
	The 'View' displays the list of the users


Directives
	ng-app
	ng-model

Expressions
	{{favMeat}}


Past examples:
	<input type="text" ng-model="favMeat" placeholder="enter your fav meat">
   <p>Your fav meat is {{favMeat}}</p>

   <p>{{ 5 * 10 }}</p>

   <!-- displaying an array -->
   <!-- <p>You like {{meats[1]}} and you also like {{meats[2]}}</p> -->
   
   <!-- initialize a data when it loads -->
    <div ng-init="color='orange'">
   	 <p class="{{color}}">Hello dudes</p>
    </div>

	<!-- ng-repeat -->
	<div ng-init="ninjas=['yoshi', 'crystal', 'ryu', 'shaun']">
		<ul>
			<li ng-repeat='ninja in ninjas'>{{ninja}}</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
